## Project management for construction.

This is a product being built by the Assembly community. You can help push this idea forward by visiting [https://assembly.com/aecore](https://assembly.com/aecore).

##Conduct
Critiques are expected. Debates are helpful and valuable. Just remember that people here are passionate about what they produce. Remember to phrase things respectfully and maintain a level of consideration. Learning from one another and trading knowledge is just as important as any bounty. This is not a competition and every opinion is valued.
##Design
To synchronize our efforts, we have a style guide. This includes guides for the following: branding, colors, typography, color treatments, and a few select UI elements. For best results during any approval process, utilize this resource to help in keeping Aecore a well defined brand.

### How Assembly Works

Assembly products are like open-source and made with contributions from the community. Assembly handles the boring stuff like hosting, support, financing, legal, etc. Once the product launches we collect the revenue and split the profits amongst the contributors.
